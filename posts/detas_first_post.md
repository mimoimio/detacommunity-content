# The Beginning  
## Aspiring Students

> *“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.”*  
> — Vincent van Gogh

### Why DeTA Exists  
Back in a near-empty computer lab one rainy evening, a few of us compared notes for an algorithms mid-term. We left that room buzzing: **learning feels different when you’re shoulder-to-shoulder with people who *want* you to succeed**. Those impromptu sessions kept growing until they needed a name. **DeTA** (Develop • Engage • Teach • Aspire) is our way of saying *everyone here is both student and teacher*.

### Our Guiding Principles  
1. **Growth Mind-Set** – fail forward, iterate, share the lesson.  
2. **Pay-It-Forward Mentorship** – each member is a node in the support graph.  
3. **Open Knowledge** – slides, code, and notes live in public repos whenever possible.  
4. **Impact over Ego** – projects are measured by value created, not by lines of code.  

### What We Do Each Month  

| Cadence | Activity | Snapshot |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Weekly  | **Study Circles** – small-group deep dives on course topics. |
| 1×/mo   | **Community Meetup** – lightning talks, demos, casual Q&A. |
| Every 6 weeks | **Hack-Along Weekend** – 48 hrs to prototype something wild. |
| Rolling | **Mentorship Pods** – 3-to-1 mentee/mentor clusters, matched by goals. |

### Success Stories (So Far)  
- **CLI Speedrun** – two first-year members built a bash-based flash-card tool now used in our OS course labs.  
- **“Game Dev 101” Series** – inspired by Roblox veterans in our ranks, we ran a four-session intro that pulled 40+ attendees.  
- **Study Buddy Bot** – an open-source Discord bot that pairs learners automatically the night before big exams.

### How *You* Can Contribute  
- **Write a Micro-Post** – anything from debugging tips to book notes.  
- **Propose a Workshop** – 20-min is plenty. We’ll help you flesh it out.  
- **Join the Review Crew** – proof-read PRs or translate docs.  
- **Sponsor Snacks** – yes, pizza remains unbeatable motivational fuel 🍕.

### The Road Ahead  
1. **Guest-Speaker Series** – alumni in industry or research every other month.  
2. **Open-Source Sprint** – group contribution drive to upstream projects.  
3. **Community Outreach** – pairing with local schools for intro-to-coding days.  
4. **Infra Upgrade** – auto-deploy previews for every blog PR and an opt-in member profile page.
